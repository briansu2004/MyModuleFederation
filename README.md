My Module Federation

## My Module federation projects

Used WebPack 5 Module federation to work on a micro frontend application.

## What is Module federation

Module federation allows a JavaScript application to dynamically run code from another bundle/build, on client and server.

This is the JavaScript bundler equivalent of what Apollo did with GraphQL.
